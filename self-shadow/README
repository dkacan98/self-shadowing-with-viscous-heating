1) Run disk_single_run.py to run the modeling. This will give the input files for radmc3d and output files of radm3d inside a directory called outputs.
2) Run diagnosticplots.py inside outputs directory. This will plot dust density and temperature distributions and dust opacity graph. 
3) Run createfits.py inside outputs directory. This will create necessary fits file out of image.out radmc3d output. 
4) Run spectra.py inside outputs directory. This will plot the spectrum from the fits file.
